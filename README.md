The Mega Dare is a web3 challenge platform where users can create dares, back them with Sepolia ETH, and the one with the most funding wins. It's simple: I HAVE TO DO WHICHEVER DARE HAS THE MOST ETH.
How it works

Create a dare - Suggest something for me to do and back it with Sepolia ETH

Boost existing dares - See a dare you like? Add ETH to make it more likely to win

The Mega Dare - Or contribute to the community-chosen dare that evolves as more people join

Each wallet can create ONE dare, but you can contribute to as many existing dares as you want.

Prerequisites
MetaMask or any Ethereum wallet
Some Sepolia ETH (it's a testnet token - not real money!)

How to participate
Visit the website and connect your wallet
If you don't have Sepolia ETH, get some from the faucet
Create your own dare OR contribute to existing ones
Watch the countdown to see which dare wins!
